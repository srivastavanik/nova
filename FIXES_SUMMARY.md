- **Model Sorting**: Proper prioritization with ChatGPT OSS 120B at the top
- **Category Definitions**: Clear separation between reasoning, premium, general, vision, coding, and math models
- **Metadata Handling**: Improved handling of link previews and search sources in websocket events
- **Feature Independence**: Web search, deep research, and thinking mode work independently without conflicts

## Known Issues Addressed
1. ✅ DeepSeek V3 no longer appears in reasoning models
2. ✅ ChatGPT OSS 120B is now the default model
3. ✅ Deep research functionality completely rebuilt
4. ✅ Web search auto-detection restored
5. ✅ File attachment handling fixed

## Key Implementation Details:

### Attachment Handling Flow:
1. User selects files in ChatInput
2. Files are converted to base64
3. Sent to backend via websocket with message
4. Backend saves attachments to database
5. Frontend receives user message with attachments
6. Message component displays attachments properly

### Web Search Display Flow:
1. User enables web search or it's auto-detected
2. Backend performs search and collects link metadata
3. Search results sent via `search_update` event
4. Final message includes `searchSources` metadata
5. SearchSources component renders link preview cards

### Deep Research Improvements:
- Performs 30 specialized queries across 7 categories
- Analyzes 20-30 unique sources
- Token limit increased to 16,384 (vs 8,192 for thinking, 4,096 for standard)
- Real-time progress updates during research
- Comprehensive report with executive summary and bibliography

## Remaining Considerations:

If attachments or search previews still don't appear after these fixes:
1. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Verify websocket events are being received (check Network tab)
3. Ensure backend is properly returning metadata in responses
4. Check that the database migrations for attachments have been run

The implementation is complete, but real-world testing may reveal edge cases that need additional handling.
